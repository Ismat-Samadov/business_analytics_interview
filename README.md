Campaign Feasibility Analysis

Overview
This Excel spreadsheet is designed to help analyze the feasibility of a campaign offering 5% cashback 
for supermarket purchases to Birbank Cashback credit cardholders. 
By inputting certain assumptions and utilizing provided formulas, 
users can evaluate the potential net profit/loss and return on investment (ROI) of the campaign.

Assumptions
1. Average spending per Birbank Cashback credit cardholder at supermarkets: $200
2. Percentage of cardholders expected to utilize the cashback offer: 50%
3. Cost of the cashback program: $10,000

Calculations
- Projected increase in supermarket spending due to the cashback offer = Average spending * Percentage of cardholders * Cashback rate
- Total cashback expenses = Projected increase in spending * Cashback rate
- Net profit/loss = Total cashback expenses - Cost of the cashback program

Financial Analysis
- ROI = (Net profit / Cost of the cashback program) * 100
